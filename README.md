My Log Analyzer 
What is this?
A simple Python tool I built to scan server logs and catch Brute-Force attacks automatically.

How it works:
Scans Logs: Finds "Failed password" attempts in the system.

Identifies Attackers: Grabs the IP address of anyone trying to break in.

Reports: Saves the list of attackers into a security_report.csv file.

Why I made it?
To practice Python for Cybersecurity and learn how to automate security tasks instead of doing them manually.
